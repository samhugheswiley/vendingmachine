breakout rooms
        accidentally closed it

ah could be
am I all good to close it?

        will it stay up?

So I can push the files, and then the files will all be in the repo, but the like thing we're using here won't be
        sure


what have we got left to do still

Errrm, I think we're quite close, I think we need to do some stuf with the change class becuase it's not doing anything really, and add some tests. What I would suggest is, I'll push this to main
and then I'll make a branch as like a backup, so if people want to work on the main branch that's fine, or if people want to essentially fork and work on it themselves they can also?
and then can merge changes later


        sounds good
        Sweet, I'll delete this, push to main, and make some branches, have a good evening!

if you've got a problem email me if you need  I think it's bmcdona2@wiley.com
